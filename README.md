# Public Solar Datasets

This is a repository by [Solytic](https://www.solytic.com) that contains public datasets.

## Structure

The structure of this repository follows the Delta Lake architecture with bronze, silver, and gold tables.

For now, we only have a single directory in here: `bronze/`. It contains some sample raw data as it arrived in our system.

Refer to the README files in the respective folders for more information.
